## Supporting data files

There are two supporting tables that are used for the grade conversion.

    Countries.csv - This table contains information which grading schemes are used by each country

    grade_table.csv - This table contains information, about the grade conversion of different grading schemes

Note: Only the schemes and grades needed for this project were added. In case other data is used it might be necessary to add additional grading schemes to these tables.
